# Overview

Autolib' is an electric car sharing service which based in Paris, France. It is operated by the Bolloré industrial group. The Autolib' scheme maintained a fleet of all-electric Bolloré Bluecars for public use on a paid subscription basis, employing a citywide network of parking and charging stations.The company had over 3,980 Bluecars registered for the service, and the scheme had more than 126,900 registered subscribers. Autolib' furthermore offered more than 1,084 electric car station points.

To enable the company to make more customer based decisions a study is undertaken to study Which day had a greater number of bluecars taken from stations.The hypothesis seeks to answer whether there is a substantial difference between the number of bluecars taken from different stations on Mondays and Fridays.

# Hypothesis

The hypothesis that the number of Bluecars used on Mondays is similar to Bluecars used on Fridays against the alternative hypothesis that the number of Bluecars used on Mondays varies from Bluecars used on Fridays.

Ho: mu₁ = mu₂.

H1: mu₁ != mu₂

Where m1 is the mean of cars used on Monday while m2 is the mean of cars used on Friday
